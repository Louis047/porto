# Porto - Secure, Peer-to-Peer Browser Data Transfer

Porto is a **privacy-first browser data migration tool** that allows users to securely transfer their browsing history, bookmarks, and cookies from a PC to a mobile device **without relying on cloud services** or Google/Microsoft accounts.

## 🔍 Why Porto?

### ✅ 1. Privacy-Oriented Users Avoid Google/Big Tech Tracking
- Unlike Chrome Sync, Porto **does not require a Google or Microsoft account**.
- No data is stored on external servers—**everything is encrypted and transferred locally**.
- Designed for privacy-conscious users who **do not want their browsing data stored in the cloud**.

## 🚀 How Porto Works
1. **User initiates the process in the Web App** by clicking "Create QR".
2. **The web app prompts the user to install the Porto browser extension**, which acts as a bridge between the browser and server.
3. **The browser extension fetches browsing data** (history, bookmarks, cookies) and sends it to the server.
4. **The server encrypts the data using AES-256 encryption**.
5. **A QR code is generated on the server** containing the encrypted data.
6. **The web app displays the QR code** for scanning.
7. **Another client scans the QR code**, retrieves the key, and gains access.
8. **The mobile device decrypts the information and applies the data to the browser automatically**.
9. **Peer-to-peer (P2P) connections** are established for direct data transfers between devices.

## 🔐 Security & Encryption
- **AES-256 encryption** is used to protect browser data before transmission.
- **QR codes expire after a short duration**, ensuring one-time use.
- **Peer-to-peer (P2P) communication** is leveraged to enable direct, encrypted transfers between clients.

## 📌 Getting Started
1. **Open the Porto Web App** and click "Create QR".
2. **Follow the prompt to install the Porto browser extension**.
3. **Scan the QR code on your mobile device**.
4. **Access and apply your browsing data securely**.

## 📅 Roadmap
- 🔄 **Mobile-to-PC Transfer** (Reverse migration support)
- 🔗 **WebRTC & P2P Support** for direct peer-to-peer transfers
- 🔄 **Firefox Support** (Currently in development)
- 🛡 **Multi-layered Encryption** for additional security

Note: Porto is built for those who **value their privacy** and want **complete control over their browsing data**. No accounts. No cloud. Just secure, peer-to-peer transfers.
